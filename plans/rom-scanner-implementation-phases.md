# ROM Scanner Implementation - Phased Plan

## Overview

This document breaks down the ROM scanner implementation into small, manageable phases. Each phase should be completed and manually validated before proceeding to the next.

## Phase 10: Integration with Existing App (30 minutes)

### Goals
- Add scanner to existing navigation
- Connect with game loading system
- Test full integration

### Tasks
1. **Add to Navigation**
   - Add scanner screen/tab to existing app
   - Update navigation structure

2. **Connect with Game System**
   - Integration point for generated YAML
   - Connect scanner results with game launcher

3. **Final Testing**
   - Test complete workflow
   - Verify compatibility with existing features
   - Performance testing with real ROM files

### Validation Criteria
- [ ] Scanner is accessible from main app
- [ ] Generated games can be launched
- [ ] No conflicts with existing functionality
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
