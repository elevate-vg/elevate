# WebView Migration Completed ✅

Successfully migrated from require()-based WebView content loading to Metro's asset resolution system.

## What Changed

### ✅ Phase 1: Hybrid System (Completed)
- Created Metro asset loader using Expo's Asset API
- Added HTML files as Metro assets in metro.config.js
- Built both CommonJS and Metro asset versions

### ✅ Phase 2: Switch to Metro Assets (Completed)
- Updated App.tsx to use new webview-manager with async asset loading
- Migrated from synchronous require() to asynchronous Asset API
- Maintained backward compatibility with require() fallbacks

### ✅ Phase 3: Cleanup Legacy System (Completed)
- Removed old webview-manager.ts
- Renamed webview-manager-v2.ts to webview-manager.ts
- Simplified build process to prioritize Metro assets
- Removed placeholder system from build commands
- Updated validation to check Metro assets

## New Architecture

### Primary Loading Strategy
1. **Metro Asset System** (preferred) - Uses Expo's Asset API with proper bundling
2. **Cached Content** - Avoids re-loading assets
3. **CommonJS Fallback** - Legacy require() for compatibility
4. **Fallback HTML** - Last resort error page

### Build Process
```bash
npm run ui::build
# Generates:
# - src/apps/android/assets/webview-content.html (Metro asset)
# - src/shared/ui/dist/webview-content.js (legacy fallback)
```

### Benefits Achieved
- ✅ **Better bundling optimization** by Metro
- ✅ **Proper asset dependency tracking**
- ✅ **Cleaner async/sync API**
- ✅ **Maintained backward compatibility**
- ✅ **Simplified build process**
- ✅ **Eliminated placeholder system**

## Files Changed
- `src/apps/android/App.tsx` - Now uses async asset loading
- `src/apps/android/services/webview-manager.ts` - Enhanced with Metro assets
- `src/apps/android/services/webview-asset-loader.ts` - New Asset API wrapper
- `metro.config.js` - Added HTML asset support
- `scripts/build-webview-string.js` - Generates Metro assets
- `scripts/validate-webview-content.js` - Validates Metro assets
- `package.json` - Simplified build commands

## Migration Complete

The app now uses Metro's asset resolution system for optimal bundling while maintaining fallbacks for reliability. The build process is simpler and the code is cleaner.
