Alpha -> Beta
=====

switch to prisma migrate (currently forcing db changes, could loose data)

FIX
=====

run prisma-bin.js during build

init (blocking)
  check/install prisma 
  if no DB
    npx prisma db push
  if db
    backup
    migrate?
    restore?

Init stage (spawn)
  DATABASE_URL="file:${full_dp_path}" node ${path_to_prisma_cli} db push --schema ${full_schema_path}
